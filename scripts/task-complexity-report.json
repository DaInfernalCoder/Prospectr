      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the environment setup into subtasks for cloning the boilerplate, installing dependencies, configuring environment variables, setting up the database schema and extensions, configuring security policies, and initializing version control.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple distinct activities (dependency management, environment configuration, database schema, security, and version control). Each step is foundational and requires careful sequencing and validation, making the overall complexity above average but not extreme."
